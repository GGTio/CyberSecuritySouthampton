Find good bin sizes:
  2*(13.220-4.885)/(200^(1/3)) = 2.85

therefore we need to divide 24 in 2.85 to know the number of breaks: 24/2.85 = 8.42

typical scores
  - mean = average (influenced by extreme values)
  - median = middle value (not influenced)
  - mode
  - geometrical mean
range of scores
  - min
  - max
  - mean absolute deviation
  - variation (linearly from the mean) can help us compare distributions
  - standard deviation
  - quartiles and interquartile range:
    - IQR = betweel Q1 and Q3 (Q3-Q1)
how spread out are the scores
even distribution ? symmetrical distribution ?
  - skewness (direction and lop-sidedness in a distribution):
    - old = (mean-median)/standard deviation
    - new = mu_3/mu_2^3/2
  - kurtosis (explains if the variance happnes because of big variations or frequent ones):
    - mu_4/mu_2^2
