## Data

Times of catches for a fisherman
(X,Y)

## Steps

### First 
- plot the distribution of X (times[hour,%ofHour]) and Y (sizes[Kg])
- characterize and discribe:
	- median
	- mean values
	- variance
	- ... (check lecture for all the relevant data to include)
- Considering the sample coming from a larger population:
	- give mean values with 95% confidence intervals for both distributions

### Second
- analyze the dependence of time of catch and size of catch:
	- plot that shows he dependende of X and Y and discuss
	- characterise the relationship using statistical measures 
	- analyse the amount of information about Y given by knowing X
	- which interval has the lowest average rate of catching and which has the highest average
