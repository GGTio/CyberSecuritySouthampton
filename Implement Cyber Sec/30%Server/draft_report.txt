Executive Summary
Briefly headline the major vulnerabilities found, conclusions made, and remedial action taken.


EXAMPLE:
Vulnerability Assessment
Open HTTP proxy on port 8080
Details: An open instance of Squid Proxy Server (/usr/bin/squid) was found on port 8080, configured with a default configuration allowing any internet user to use the server as an open proxy.
Classification: CWE-16 (Configuration)
Exploitability: 5 - Any remote internet user can connect and proxy through the server
Severity: 3 - Internet users can conceal their IP address when performing abuse, bouncing through the server instead, potentially breaking laws or terms of use and putting undue load on the server.
Overall risk: 5*3 = 15
Remedial Action
Open HTTP proxy on port 8080
Action: Squid Proxy Server was disabled and removed
Justification: The service did not appear to have any legitimate use and was not part of the requirements and appears to have been enabled by accident, with a default configuration.
Resolved: Yes


Yeah for the draft we don’t need all that, just leaving it here for when we’ll do the full report :)
