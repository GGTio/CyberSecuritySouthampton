Use of attack trees in the analysis of cyber security threats (ok)
All Aspects of Security (cool superviser, need to find subject)
Risk Based Access Control (Harden authentication methods)
A specification for blockchains (I like blockchains, this seems to be a way of implementing them)
Low Cost Security Protocols for Resource-Constrained Systems (crypto for IoT)
Wireless Physical Layer Security (very theoretical wireless security)
Coding practices to mitigate risk holistically (soft eng and security + maintenance )

Virtual Learning environment for Application Security (pretty cool, a lot of web dev with maybe a game/VR/enhaced reality goal)
Sniffing out tampered, malicious and counterfeit parts (seems interesting, not sure if too low level)
Engineering for secure solutions (improve current soft eng security approaches ? could be interesting)
Security in the Internet of Things (system diagrams -> formal statements -> checked for consistency | might need more info to fully understand the project)
