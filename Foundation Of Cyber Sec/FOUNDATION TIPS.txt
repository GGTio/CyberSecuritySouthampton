FOUNDATION

WHAT HE LIKES:
- short answers
- Start the answer by putting the in context, explaining the context.
(the context is explaining where the question belongs to. For example: There are 3 classes of 
anonymisation, the one you are asked belongs to x and is characterized by doing this)
- 2 types of questions: textbook and problem solving => 2 ways to answer
	TEXTBOOK: short answer shows understanding and proves you know the topic.
	Problem Solving: same as for the textbook but no need for conclusion
- Show that you know the material, structure of answers:
	A. Introduction with opening sentence that puts context and specialize to get to the point
	B. Answer the question
	C. Conclusion -> own assessment about the object (give drawbacks or other options to show you mastered the mterial)

	Ex with biometrics:
	A: Caracterize someone by his knowledge, his person, ...
	B: give 3-4 different types of biometric authentication methods + their pros and cons
	C: End up with a personal conslusion on the topic.
